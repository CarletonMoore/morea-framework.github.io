        <h3>Make your content more accessible</h3>

        <p>Teachers often organize courses
        into a sequence of a dozen or more <em>modules</em>.  Each
        module has one or more <em>learning outcomes</em>, which identify what
        the students should know if they successfully complete the module.
        The module's educational content often combines one or more passive <em>readings</em>
        (providing background and reference material) with one or more
        active <em>experiences</em> (typically homework assignments, events, or
        in-class group work).  Finally, the teacher creates one or more <em>assessment</em>
        that determine if the students have achieved the learning outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>Morea makes this (often implicit) course structure explicit through a set
        of pages that present the course content organized not just by modules, but
        also by learning outcomes, readings, learning experiences, and assessments.
        This helps students not only as they work on the current module, but when they
        review the content later (even after the course is over!)</p>
