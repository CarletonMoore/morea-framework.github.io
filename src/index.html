        <h3>Make the pedagogy visible</h3>

        <p>Teachers often organize courses
        into a sequence of a dozen or more <em>modules</em>.  Each
        module has one or more <em>learning outcomes</em>, which identify what
        the students should know if they successfully complete the module.
        The module's educational content often combines one or more passive <em>readings</em>
        (providing background and reference material) with one or more
        active <em>experiences</em> (typically homework assignments, events, or
        in-class group work).  Finally, the teacher creates one or more <em>assessment</em>
        that determine if the students have achieved the learning outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>Morea makes this (often implicit) course structure explicit through a set
        of pages that present the course content organized not just by modules, but
        also by learning outcomes, readings, learning experiences, and assessments.
        This helps students not only as they work on the current module, but when they
        review the content later (even after the course is over!)</p>

      <h3>Simplify development with Github</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> provides marvelous technology for design, development, and delivery
        of educational websites:
        <ul>
          <li>Free storage of content.</li>
          <li>Free private repositories for educators.</li>
          <li>Free hosting of course websites.</li>
          <li>The ability to clone, branch, and fork repositories.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Morea leverages these capabilities to make it easier to create courses and
      improve them over time.  Morea and Github help you
      collaborate with students and teachers to create and improve
      educational content. </p>

      <h3>Simplify presentation with Jekyll</h3>

      <p>
        Nice websites involve lots of CSS and HTML, which is a pain to maintain manually.
        <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a "static site generator" that enables you to develop
        your course content in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
        format without using HTML.
      </p>

      <p>Morea leverages Jekyll to separate HTML/CSS presentation details
        from your course content.
        Morea gives you a nice, responsive website without any presentation details in your content.
