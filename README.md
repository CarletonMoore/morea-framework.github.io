What does Morea stand for?
--------------------------

Morea (pronounced "Mariah") is an acronym for Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments. These are
the five building blocks of our approach to creating online course web sites, where:

* A *course* consists of a sequence of modules;
* A *module* consists of one or more outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments.
* An *outcome* is a "student learning outcome", or educational goal for the module.
* A *reading* is an online resource (web page, PDF file, YouTube video, etc.) providing explanations useful to
achievement of one or more of the outcomes.
* An *experience* is an activity with which the learner engages in order to acquire the information. Sometimes these
are referred to as "homework assignments".  They could also be meetings or events. They typically help the learner
to assimilate information in the readings.
* An *assessment* is a mechanism used to help the learner determine if they have actually achieved the desired outcomes.

Goal of Morea
-------------

The goal of the Morea project is to make it as easy for educators to create, share, and modify
educational material organized according to these building blocks, and publish the results as web sites. We attempt
 to accomplish this in the following way:

* Each Morea course is a (typically private) GitHub repository.  Note that educators (with a .edu account) can get a
free "micro" GitHub account with 5 private repositories. The repo can contain both private content (such as tests) and
 public content (the published web site).

* A Morea course repository is structured in way that makes it easy to run the repo contents through
 [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publish the resulting website using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

* We will supply templates you can use to build course websites from scratch.  Even better, you can fork a repo
created by another educator and modify it to suit your own purposes. It's up to you.
