     <h1>Basic concepts</h1>

<p>To begin, here are the most important principles underlying the framework.</p>

<p><strong>Morea defines five &quot;entity types&quot;: module, outcome, reading, experience, and assessment.</strong></p>

<p>A <em>module</em> is a container that holds a set of outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments related
to course content. Modules have a sort order, which allows you to organize modules into a sequence. Most
courses consist of 6 to 30+ modules.  A module can contain zero to many instances of outcomes, readings,
experiences, and assessments. It is possible to define a module without zero outcomes, zero readings, zero experiences,
and zero assessments, though we&#39;re not sure of the utility of such a module.</p>

<p>An <em>outcome</em> represents some kind of knowledge or capability that the student should acquire as a result of
the readings and experiences in the associated module.  A module can have multiple outcomes.  Conversely, the same
outcome can be associated with multiple modules. We find that a useful way to organize and express learning outcomes
 is through <a href="http://www.utar.edu.my/fegt/file/Revised_Blooms_Info.pdf">Bloom&#39;s revised taxonomy</a>, which classifies
 outcomes into six categories: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. The latter outcomes
 (analyzing, evaluating, and creating) are supposed to represent &quot;high-order&quot; cognitive skills.</p>

<p>A <em>reading</em> is an artifact that the student studies: it represents &quot;passive&quot; learning. Readings are typically
chapters in a book, online web pages, and so forth.</p>

<p>In contrast to a reading, an <em>experience</em> represents a more &quot;active&quot; form of learning in which the student solves
problems or performs other activities in order to acquire understanding and capability. Morea distinguishes between
readings and experiences because modules that contain only readings without experiences will tend to have outcomes associated
with lower levels of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy, while modules containing a mixture of readings and experiences are more
likely to support outcomes at higher levels of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy.</p>

<p>An <em>assessment</em> is an activity that evaluates the success of the student in achieving the educational goals
of the module.  In the best case, the educational goals of the module are adequately expressed by learning outcomes,
in which case each assessment should relate to one or more outcomes.  The graphic
<a href="images/Stobaugh_BloomsTaxonomy.png">Applying Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy in your Classroom</a> provides various examples of how
outcomes and assessments can be linked together.  While Morea can help make linkages between outcomes and
assessments clear, it is common to assess skills not encapsulated by outcomes, or desire outcomes that are not
assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Morea generates five &quot;views&quot; of the content, each organized according to an entity.</strong></p>

<p>Morea sites contain a navigation bar at the top of the page with links to pages that organize the content
according to each of the five entities: modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments.
For example, here is an example of the Readings page:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-readings.png" width="600px" /></p>

<p>And here is an example of the Outcomes page:</p>

<p><img src="images/ics311-outcomes.png" width="600px" /></p>

<p>You can see that the two pages highlight a single entity type but provide links to other entities for context.</p>

<p>We believe that presenting the content organized according to different entity types makes it easier for
students and educators to understand the conceptual structure of the course.   For educators, it also
provides a useful way to see if the course is structurally coherent. For example, when the learning
objectives are examined together, do they create a coherent set?   For another example, are there assessments for each module,
and if not, is that appropriate?</p>

<p><strong>Every Morea entity has its own markdown file.</strong></p>

<p>Every instance of a Morea entity (module, outcome, reading, experience, assessment) is represented by a single markdown file.
There can also be other markdown files and other non-markdown files (such as the logo image file associated with each module).</p>

<p><strong>All of your course content is located in the src/morea/ directory.</strong></p>

<p>When you first clone a Morea site, you will find a potentially bewildering number of files and directories. For example:</p>

<p><img src="images/morea-source.png" width="200px" /></p>

<p>This organization exists because the Morea framework is basically just a Jekyll site with a custom plugin to process the Morea markdown files.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the only files you will typically need to manage are all located in the src/morea directory. Here is
an example of the src/morea directory from the basic-template system:</p>

<p><img src="images/morea-folder.png" width="200px" /></p>

<p>This folder contains all of the files you will want to manage as part of your course content.</p>

<p><strong>You can organize the src/morea/ directory any way you like.</strong></p>

<p>The Morea framework does not care how you organize the files within the src/morea directory.
For example, you can place all of your files at the top level of this directory.
Alternatively, and more typically, you can create subdirectories within the src/morea directory, one
per module, as shown in the previous screenshot.</p>

<p>In addition, Morea does not care how you name files.  In fact, it is
possible to use the same file name in multiple modules (i.e. foo/module.md, bar/module.md, baz/module.md, and
qux/module.md in the screenshot above)</p>

<p><strong>It is the &quot;front matter&quot; in each Morea entity file that uniquely identifies it.</strong></p>

<p>Morea does not care about directory structure nor file name, because it uses the <em>front matter</em> in the
markdown file to uniquely identify each Morea entity and determine how they relate to each other.
&quot;Front matter&quot; is a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> term for key-value pairs
represented via YAML notation and separated from the rest of the file contents by three dashes. For example,
here is the front matter for a hypothetical module entity:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">---
title: &quot;Learn to Foo&quot;
morea_id: foo
morea_outcomes:
  - foo-outcome1
  - foo-outcome2
morea_readings:
  - foo-reading
morea_experiences:
  - foo-experience
morea_assessments:
  - foo-assessment
morea_type: module
morea_icon_url: /morea/images/foo.png
morea_labels:
  - required
  - intro
morea_sort_order: 2
---
</code></pre></div>
<p>So, even though each module (foo, bar, baz, qux) in the basic template system contains a file with the name module.md,
the front matter in that file will be different in order to represent the unique structure of the four modules.</p>

<p>Note that while you <em>can</em> use the same name, you <em>don&#39;t have to</em>.   You could name the file containing the front
matter for the Foo module &quot;module-foo.md&quot;.  You could even name it &quot;outcome.md&quot; (although that would be really
confusing.) The point is:  Morea does not utilize file name information.</p>

<p>We will explain the front matter in more detail later in this User Guide.</p>

<p><strong>Morea makes a &quot;mirror image&quot; of the src/morea directory in the published HTML site.</strong></p>

<p>Because we want you to provide course content in the src/morea directory, and because course content can include
(for example) image files, Morea creates a kind of &quot;mirror image&quot; of the src/morea directory in the published site
so that your content can include links within itself as well as to external sites.</p>

<p>The basic rule is that markdown files are converted to HTML in the published site, and all other files get copied
over without change. So, for example, here is the src/morea directory (on the left) and the site&#39;s published morea directory
(on the right):</p>

<p><img src="images/mirror-image.png" width="400px" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the markdown files have become HTML, and the sole non-markdown file (logo.png) has been copied over
unchanged.  The directory structure below the morea/ directory is unchanged.</p>

<h1>Related systems</h1>

<p>Another way to understand Morea is by contrasting it with other tools used by educators to create course content.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gitbook.io/">GitBook</a>, like Morea, creates educational websites using Markdown and Git.  If you want to
write a textbook, GitBook is a better choice.  Morea is preferred when you want to create a course curriculum from
a variety of sources including your own and/or other sources, and when you want to make learning objectives and
assessments explicit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">Blackboard</a> is a commercial offering that provides comprehensive support for all
aspects of course management: content management, testing, grading, etc.
Morea provides a small subset of the capabilities of Blackboard, but is free, simpler to use, and facilitates
sharing through its underlying use of Git and GitHub.  Morea is oriented toward &quot;public&quot; materials, since by default
the materials you create can be accessed by anyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.metacademy.org/">Metacademy</a> is a site for community curated educational content.  Unlike Morea,
Metacademy supports a single version of curriculum material for any given topic.  In contrast, Morea tries to make it
as easy as possible for each educator to have their own, slightly (or radically) different version of curriculum
material for any given topic.  It&#39;s much like the difference between centralized version control (i.e. SVN) where there is
always a single &quot;golden&quot; version of a system, and distributed version control (i.e. git) where there can be many &quot;different
but equal&quot; versions of a system.</p>

<h1>Anatomy of a Module</h1>

<p>This section overviews the structure of the module <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/basic-template/tree/master/src/morea/foo">Foo</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/basic-template">basic-template</a> system.  Here is a
graphic to help illustrate the various components:</p>

<p><img src="images/module-anatomy.jpg" width="800px"/></p>

<p>The top row illustrates various &quot;source&quot; files, and the bottom row illustrates various &quot;output&quot; HTML pages
produced from these files.</p>

<p>The top right window shows the contents of the src/morea/foo directory. There are various files in there that define
the content associated with the Foo module.  Interestingly, there are a couple of files in this directory that are
not associated with the Foo module.  The presence of non-Foo content in the foo directory illustrates that the directory and file organization
of the morea/ directory is arbitrary.</p>

<p>The second window on the top row shows the content of module.md.  The content of this file is mostly Front Matter,
and provides the definition of the Foo module.  The outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments associated with
the Foo module are all referenced by unique IDs.</p>

<p>The third and fourth windows on the top row show the content of two files that define a reading and an experience entity.
These entities have unique IDs that are referenced in the definition of the Foo module, and that is the way that Morea
connects them together.</p>

<p>The bottom row shows a variety of pages produced by Morea.  Because a module was defined in the module.md file, it
will show up in the modules/ page.  Clicking on the link in the modules page takes you to a page which details the
contents of that module. As you can see, the content associated with each of the unique IDs referenced in the module.md file shows up in this
page.  The other pages illustrate the content (such as a Reading) will not only appear in the module (or modules) with
which it is associated, but also in the Readings page.</p>

<p>In summary, Morea markdown files create a set of entities, each of which are identified by a unique ID.  The
contents of a module (outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments) are specified by providing unique IDs. The
relationship between modules and its content entities is many-to-many. First, a module can refer to multiple outcomes,
readings, experiences, and assessments. Conversely, any given outcome, reading, experiences, and assessment can
appear in multiple modules.</p>

<h1>Morea entity types</h1>

<p>This section documents the structure and behavior of the five Morea entity types.</p>

<h3>Module</h3>

<p>Modules are represented by a markdown file where the Front Matter defines the structure of the module
and the body of the file (typically a sentence or two) summarizes the module contents.</p>

<p><strong>Sample module markdown file contents</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">---
title: &quot;Learn to Foo&quot;
published: true
morea_id: foo
morea_outcomes:

<p><strong>Module body text</strong></p>

<p>In a module definition, the text following the Front Matter is typically one to two sentences that
summarizes the module content. This text appears with the module&#39;s <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails">thumbnail</a> in the module summary page and at the top
of the module&#39;s page.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>Each outcome represents knowledge or capability that the educator hopes the students will acquire as a
result of the module or modules in which this outcome appears.</p>

<p><strong>Sample outcome markdown file contents</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">---

<p><strong>Outcome body text</strong></p>

<p>In an outcome definition, the text following the Front Matter describes
 the outcome. This text appears both in all of the Module pages referring to this outcome,
 as well as on the Outcomes page</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>Each reading represents a &quot;passive&quot; learning opportunity associated with the module.
There are two types of readings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Readings in which the material is &quot;inline&quot;, as the body text associated with the file.</li>
<li>Readings in which the material is &quot;online&quot;, and the Front Matter provides a link to that material.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether or not the reading is &quot;inline&quot; or &quot;online&quot; depends upon whether the keyword morea_url appears
in the Front Matter.   Here are examples of each:</p>

<p><strong>Sample &quot;inline&quot; reading markdown file contents</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">---

<p><strong>Reading body text</strong></p>

<p>When the morea_url keyword is provided to specify the URL, then no body text need appear. When the
morea_url keyword is absent, then the body text should be the intended reading.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>Each experience represents an active learning opportunity associated with the module.
Experiences appear as the body text of the file.</p>

<p><strong>Sample experience markdown file contents</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">---

## Asymptotic Concepts

#### 5 points

**1\. (1 pt)** We can extend asymptotic notation to the case of two parameters n and m that can go to infinity independently at different rates. For example, we denote by O(g(n,m)) the set of functions:

&gt; O(_g_(_n_,_m_)) = {_f_(_n_,_m_) : there exists positive constants _c_, _n_0
and _m_0 such that 0 ≤ _f_(_n_,_m_) ≤ _c__g_(_n_,_m_) for all _n_ ≥ _ _n0 or
_m_ ≥ _m_0}

Give a corresponding definition for Θ(_g_(_n_,_m_)).

<p><strong>Experience body text</strong></p>

<p>The body text should describe the experience in markdown format.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>Each assessment represents the results of some activity intended to determine whether or not the students
have acquired the knowledge and/or capabilities intended by the module&#39;s readings and experiences.</p>

<p>Assessments appear as the body text of the file, typically as charts. We recommend that
you publish the assessment results in a manner that preserves student anonymity.</p>

<p>Publishing assessment results has a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Students get a sense for both how they are performing relative to others during the course.</li>
<li>Students understand how the educator is attempting to assess the learning associated with the module.</li>
<li>Assessment results become part of the &quot;public record&quot; associated with the module, facilitating future
modification and improvement of the assessment technique.</li>
</ul>

<p>To present assessment results as charts, you can include Javascript directly in the markdown file, as illustrated in the following example:</p>

<p><strong>Sample assessment markdown file contents</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">---

<p><strong>Assessment body text</strong></p>

<p>The body text should describe the assessment in markdown format.</p>

<h1>Content development</h1>

<p>The material in this section assumes that you have set up your local environment according to
the instructions in the <a href="/quickstart.html">QuickStart page</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit&gt;Compile&gt;Review&gt;Publish</h2>

<p>Development of course content with Morea follows this general sequence:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit: Modify the files in the morea/ directory.</li>
<li>Compile: Invoke the &quot;Morea compiler&quot; (i.e. jekyll) using the <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/scripts/blob/master/morea-run-local.sh">morea-run-local.sh</a> script</li>
<li>Review: Fix any errors that occur, or if no errors occur, then review the results at http://localhost:4000.</li>
<li>Publish: When satisfied with your content, publish it using the <a href="https://github.com/morea-framework/scripts/blob/master/morea-publish.sh">morea-publish.sh</a> script.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Edit phase</h2>

<p>Just edit the files using any programming text editor (vi, emacs, sublime, etc.) Don&#39;t use Word.</p>

<h2>Compile phase</h2>

<p>The morea-run-local script invokes the Jekyll compiler in &quot;watch&quot; mode, which means it will automatically
recompile the markdown files whenever it notices that they have been edited. So, for example, this is what happens
when morea-run-local is invoked in the basic-template system:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">[~/projecthosting/github/morea-framework/basic-template]-&gt; ./morea-run-local.sh

<p>This normal output shows the markdown files found by Morea, followed by any &quot;warnings&quot; (non-fatal issues) discovered during
processing of the markdown, followed by a summary of processing. At the very end, it indicates that the server
is running and that you can retrieve the site at http://localhost:4000.</p>

<p>If you edit the content associated with a file and save it out, then the compiler will be automatically invoked
and you will see more output appear similar to the above.  If you decide to install a browser
plugin like <a href="http://livereload.com/">LiveReload</a>, then the browser page displaying your output will be
refreshed automatically each time you save your source files.  This is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s see what happens when we make an error creating our content. For example, let&#39;s put a typo into
the Foo module definition file so that we reference &quot;outcome12&quot; rather than &quot;outcome1&quot;. Here&#39;s what results:</p>

    1 errors, 7 warnings
Errors found. Exiting.
&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of &quot;0 errors, 7 warnings&quot;, the compiler reports &quot;1 errors, 7 warnings&quot; and exits back to the
command line.  At this point, find the place(s) in the output where the error is reported. In this case,
you&#39;ll find:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">  Error: module.md references undefined morea_id: outcome12
</code></pre></div>
<p>This tells you name of the file with the error and the problem: in this case, a reference to an
undefined Morea ID.   Fix the problem and reinvoke morea-run-local.sh to see if the error goes away.</p>

<h2>Publish phase</h2>

<p>When you are ready to publish your content to GitHub so it can be seen publicly, invoke the
morea-publish.sh script, providing it with a commit message. For example:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<script>
  $("#nav").tocify({theme: "bootstrap3", scrollTo: "40"});
</script>

<div class="dark-blue-background">

  <div class="container page-footer">
      <p>Last update on: <span>24 Apr 2014</span></p>
